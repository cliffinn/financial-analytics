# [Financial Analytics Project](https://www.kaggle.com/code/benitoitelewuver/financial-analytics-datasets)

## Overview
This project analyzes financial data from Indian companies, focusing on market capitalization and quarterly sales. The analysis includes data visualization, correlation studies, and categorical data exploration to gain insights into the financial landscape of these companies.

## Goals
The primary goals of this financial analytics project are:

1. To understand the distribution of market capitalization and quarterly sales among Indian companies
2. To explore the relationship between market capitalization and quarterly sales
3. To analyze the breakdown of companies across different market cap and sales categories
4. To identify any patterns or trends in the financial data that could provide valuable insights for investors or market analysts
5. To demonstrate proficiency in data analysis and visualization techniques using R and its associated libraries

## Data Source
The data used in this project is sourced from the file "Financial-Analytics-data1.csv", which contains information on various Indian companies including their names, market capitalization, quarterly sales, and categorizations based on market cap and sales.

## Tools and Libraries
- R
- tidyverse
- ggplot2
- ggcorrplot

## Analysis
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization of market capitalization and sales distributions
4. Correlation analysis between market cap and sales
5. Categorical data analysis for market cap and sales categories

## Reports

This project generates several reports and visualizations to present the findings of the financial analysis:

1. **Market Capitalization Distribution Report**
   - A histogram showing the distribution of market capitalization across companies
   - Key statistics including mean, median, and quartiles of market capitalization

2. **Quarterly Sales Distribution Report**
   - A histogram depicting the distribution of quarterly sales
   - Summary statistics for quarterly sales data

3. **Market Cap vs. Sales Scatter Plot**
   - A scatter plot illustrating the relationship between market capitalization and quarterly sales
   - Color-coded by market cap category for easy visualization of company sizes

4. **Correlation Analysis Report**
   - A heatmap showing the correlation between market capitalization and quarterly sales
   - Interpretation of the correlation strength and its implications

5. **Market Cap Category Distribution Report**
   - Bar charts showing the distribution of companies across different market cap categories
   - Analysis of the balance or imbalance in company sizes within the dataset

6. **Sales Category Distribution Report**
   - Bar charts illustrating the distribution of companies across sales categories
   - Insights into the sales performance landscape of the companies in the dataset

## Key Findings
- There is a strong positive correlation between market capitalization and quarterly sales.
- The distribution of both market capitalization and quarterly sales is right-skewed, indicating a concentration of companies with lower values and fewer companies with very high values.
- The market cap categories are relatively evenly distributed among the companies in the dataset.

## Future Work
- Incorporate time series analysis to study trends over multiple quarters
- Perform sector-specific analysis to compare different industries
- Develop predictive models for market capitalization based on financial metrics
